# 0x96f theme for Zed

⚠️ **This theme is not being maintained anymore.** I have moved to Zed completely and I don't really have the time to maintaining the theme anymore. You can check out the other ports for [Zed](https://github.com/filipjanevski/zed-theme), [Micro](https://github.com/filipjanevski/0x96f-micro-theme) or [Terminal emulators](https://github.com/filipjanevski/0x96f-term-theme)

A simple and pleasant dark theme for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
